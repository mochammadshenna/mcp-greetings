# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that enables AI assistants to connect with external tools and data sources. It allows AI models like Claude to interact with specialized servers that provide specific capabilities.

### What does this server do?

The MCP Greetings Server provides multilingual greeting capabilities to AI assistants. It can say hello in 7 different languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.

### Why do I need this?

If you want your AI assistant to greet users in different languages, this server provides a simple, standardized way to do that. It's particularly useful for:

- Multilingual applications
- International user bases
- Language learning tools
- Cultural inclusivity

## Installation Questions

### Do I need to install Node.js?

Yes, Node.js 18.0.0 or higher is required. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Can I use it without installing?

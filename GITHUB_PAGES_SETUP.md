# GitHub Pages Setup Guide for Docsify

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup via GitHub Web UI

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

First, you need to push your code to the GitHub repository:

```bash
# If you haven't pushed yet, do this:
git push -u origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages via Web UI

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/mochammadshenna/mcp-greetings

2. **Navigate to Settings**:
   - Click the "Settings" tab at the top of your repository
   - It's usually the rightmost tab in the navigation bar

3. **Find Pages Section**:
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar
   - Look for "Pages" under the "Code and automation" section
   - Click on "Pages"

4. **Configure Source**:
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - This will use the workflow we already created in `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`

5. **Save Configuration**:
   - The page will automatically save your selection
   - You should see a message like "Your site is ready to be published at..."

### Step 3: Trigger the Documentation Build

The documentation will be automatically deployed when you push to the main branch. Since we already have the workflow file, you can:

1. **Make a small change** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Make a tiny change to trigger the build
   echo "# Documentation" >> docs/README.md
   git add docs/README.md
   git commit -m "Trigger docs build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Or wait for the next push** - the workflow will run automatically

### Step 4: Monitor the Build Process

1. **Check Actions Tab**:
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Look for "Deploy Documentation to GitHub Pages"
   - Click on it to see the build progress

2. **Wait for Completion**:
   - The build usually takes 1-2 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's successful

### Step 5: Access Your Documentation

Once the build completes successfully:

1. **Your documentation will be available at**:
   ```
   https://mochammadshenna.github.io/mcp-greetings/
   ```

2. **Features Available**:
   - âœ… Modern Docsify interface
   - âœ… Search functionality
   - âœ… Mobile-responsive design
   - âœ… Code syntax highlighting
   - âœ… Navigation sidebar
   - âœ… Professional theming

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Manual Setup (if needed)

If the automatic setup doesn't work, you can manually configure:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
- Source: "GitHub Actions"
- Uses: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`

### Option 2: Deploy from Branch
- Source: "Deploy from a branch"
- Branch: "main" or "gh-pages"
- Folder: "/docs"

## ðŸ“‹ What Happens Automatically

Your existing `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` file will:

1. **Trigger** on every push to main branch
2. **Install** Docsify CLI
3. **Build** the documentation from `/docs` folder
4. **Deploy** to GitHub Pages
5. **Update** the live site automatically

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After setup, your documentation site will have:

- **Homepage**: Professional landing page with project overview
- **Installation Guide**: Step-by-step installation instructions
- **API Reference**: Complete tool documentation
- **Integration Guides**: Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE setup
- **FAQ**: Common questions and answers
- **Search**: Find any content instantly

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Check the "Actions" tab for error messages
2. Ensure your `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` file exists
3. Verify the `/docs` folder contains `index.html`

### Pages Not Loading
1. Wait 5-10 minutes after first setup
2. Check repository permissions
3. Verify the repository is public

### Documentation Not Updating
1. Check if the workflow ran successfully
2. Clear browser cache
3. Wait a few minutes for CDN updates

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

- âœ… GitHub Pages shows "Your site is published at..."
- âœ… Actions tab shows successful "Deploy Documentation" runs
- âœ… https://mochammadshenna.github.io/mcp-greetings/ loads properly
- âœ… You see the professional Docsify interface with your content

**Your documentation will be live at**: https://mochammadshenna.github.io/mcp-greetings/

The setup is designed to be fully automatic - just push your code and configure the Pages source!
